java is all about class and object
class is blueprint
object inherit all class properties
java is strongly typed language

Father class is a super class of son class
java doesn't support multiple inheritance - cannot have multiple super class
inheritance is a mechanism to acquire properties from a class to another class

overloading: in the same class, having the same method name with different number of parameters
overriding: in the different class that extends to the former class (with @Overriding annotation), having the same method name with same parameters and different body

overloading is happening in compile time
overriding is happening in run time

final method cannot be overridden

encapsulation is data hiding

abstraction is implementation hiding / road map

we cannot create an instance of interface

interface is a road map for a concrete class. interface is contract between classes

in interface, all the methods are unmplemented, they are all absract methods

concrete class is a full fledge class where all the methods are impelemented

a class can implement multiple interfaces

we cannot create object of abstract class

concrete class can implement more then 1 interface but can extend only 1 abstract class

what is the difference between interface and abstract class ?
*             interface                          |                     abstract
* implicitly abstract and can not be implemented | can have instance methods that implements a default behavior
* variable declared are by default final         | may contain a non-final datatypes
* members are public by default                  | can have private, protected members
* uses keyword implements                        | uses keyword extends
* extends another interface only                 | extends another class and implements multiple interfaces
* all abstract method and can not be instantiate | can not be instantiated but can be invoked in main()
* slow                                           | comparatively fast

what is the difference between final, finally and finalize

finalize is a block of code invoked during the garbage collection

garbage collection is when java deletes the unused objects created

Integer is wrapper class of int
Character is wrapper class of char

what is the difference between list and set
list is ordered / can accept duplicates
set is  not ordered / don't accept duplicates
